- If ollydbg.exe renamed to any other name then the internal main window variable is NULL.
  Because of this some of the protection not working properly with renamed executable.
  The workaround is simply don't rename :) Bug reported to Oleh.

- Some of the protections contains hardcoded structure offsets which are highly windows
  version dependent. The actual implementation only contain offsets for win7. I can
  support additional OS based on specific request.
